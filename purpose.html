                Horoscopes have always been a hit or a miss for everyone still; people come back to them, try to make
                sense of it and fit it according to their life experiences.
                The psychological phenomenon Barnum effect explains the reason why horoscope draws people. If you
                notice, horoscopes are generally very vague and written so that
                they can be interpreted in multiple ways so that they apply to almost anybody. Suppose the reader wants
                to believe in it. In that case, they will try to seek a
                correspondence betweenthe horoscope and their life experience. Once they find any connection, this
                reinforces their bias; and they start feeling by reading horoscopes,
                they know about something that will happen in future.

                Now, this website is <b>not</b> advocating anything against astrology. Astrology tries to find
                correlations between the life affairs of earthly beings with the motion of
                celestial objects. It is a result of observing these heavenly bodies for thousands of years. It is a
                very interesting field, applying multiple mathematical models
                over complex planetary motions, geological coordinates, dates, etc. and drawing inferences from the data
                gathered by observing how similar planetary locations
                affected someone in the past. However, these inferences don't have any scientific backing. Does the
                planet's position affect the life of any earthling? Nobody knows
                for sure. In the end, it's the astrologer's skill to get it out from the person what they want to hear.
                They sometimes help people get through difficult life phases
                by blaming it on some celestial body's position. They suggest that they do prayers/meditate, which
                eventually helps them cope with difficulties. Shoutout to those !!

                This website is a fun experiment. This website uses LLM to produce sentences that
                sound like a horoscope. The model outputs 12 random sentences,
                one for each zodiac sign. It will be fascinating to see if people can still modify the random sentence
                and find any connection with any personal event. It will also
                be terrifying if people start believing in it, considering these are outputs of an AI.

            <h>What are those dots behind each horoscope?</h>

            <p>
                Those dots are the star constellations which are associated with the Astrological sign. When you click
                on them, some connect to form figures of mythological creatures or animals or people
                related to zodiac signs. There is no standard representation of any constellations. After clicking on
                them, the figure you see is something that I found online, mainly on the IAU's website or
                something that I liked or created. You can quickly draw a parallel between this and how horoscopes work.
                One tries to connect stars to form a figure and match
                with something that he wants to see. Similarly, horoscopes are vague, but people can still match them
                with something they experience, even if that connection is paper-thin.

                I am not an expert in Web/ UI development. There may be many discrepancies in the website design, and I
                would not have followed many UI standards in multiple places.
                After working on this project, my respect for Web/UI developers increased multi-fold. I have tried to
                keep the design as clean as possible and not use much CSS.
                If you are a web developer and something irks you while browsing this website, I would appreciate it if
                you could contribute to the page. I have made the template
                page for the website public on <a href="https://github.com/shashwattrivedi/DailyAIHoroscope-Webpage">Github</a> . You can raise issues that you see or contribute to the design.
                This template is filled in with the model's output to produce the horoscope page. You can
                contribute your representation of the constellation on the Github page. Let's see if your visualisation
                is better.
                <br>

                Also, if any written content except the horoscope is not clear, please raise the issue on the Github
                page. I do not intend to hurt any sentiment in any way; people are free to believe
                in whatever they want to believe, just use common sense before becoming dependent on anything.
